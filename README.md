# phpnmysql
This repo discusses 
 bringing up php and mysql using docker-compose
 and networking as "host" / bridge.
 Later I brought different containers using docker stack, as docker-compose is going to be deprecated.
 It discuss about docker secrets as well.
 Feel free to fork and in case of issues please raise it.
