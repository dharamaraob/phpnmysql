# phpnmysql
This repo discusses <br/>
 bringing up php and mysql using docker-compose <br/>
 and networking as "host" / bridge.<br/>
 Later I brought different containers using docker stack with overlay network, as docker-compose is going to be deprecated.<br/>
 It discuss about docker secrets as well.<br/>
 Feel free to fork and in case of issues please raise it.<br/>
